- 👋 Hi, I’m @invictus-anic3tus
- 👀 I’m interested in coding, electronics-ing, and all things design and mechanics!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to build my own 3D printer! It's super fun! Check out my Anicept Vex project ;)
- 📫 You can find me on Hack Club's Slack (what's hack club? visit [their site](https://hack.club)) as @Anicetus or friend me on discord, anic3tus
- 😄 I'm a cool dude from the U. S. A. 😎
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm currently building: 1) A 3d printer, 2) a drone, and 3) a keyboard all from scratch without guides!
